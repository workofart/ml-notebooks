# ML-Algorithms

This repository contains simple implementations for various machine learning algorithms.
The purpose is to implement the key ideas using the simplest possible code (mostly for personal learning purposes).

## Bootstrap environment
`./bootstrap.sh` will install all the necessary dependencies.

Then you can activate the installed virtual environment by `source .venv/bin/activate`.

## Repository Structure

- Root directory
  - `.py` files: Contains the implementations of the algorithms.
  - `.ipynb` files: Contains the notebooks for the algorithms.
- `visualizations/`: Contains the visualizations for the algorithms.

## Running visualizations

`python -m visualizations.<algorithm>` will run the visualization for the specified algorithm.

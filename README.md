# ML-Algorithms

This repository contains simple implementations for various machine learning algorithms.
The purpose is to implement the key ideas using the simplest possible code (mostly for personal learning purposes).

## Bootstrap environment
`./bootstrap.sh` will install all the necessary dependencies.

Then you can activate the installed virtual environment by `source .venv/bin/activate`.
